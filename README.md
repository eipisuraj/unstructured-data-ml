CNN Image Classification â€“ Unstructured Data ML
This repository contains code, notebooks, and resources for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classification project using transfer learning from the ImageNetV2 dataset and pretrained models in TensorFlow/Keras.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images into multiple categories by leveraging a pretrained ImageNetV2-based CNN model. Transfer learning is used to adapt the model to a 10,000-image dataset while maintaining strong generalization performance.

For demonstration, the model was trained on a dog breed classification dataset, but the methodology is fully generalizable to other image classification tasks, including engineering-related problems such as defect detection, equipment monitoring, and pattern recognition in experimental data.
